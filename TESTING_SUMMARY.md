## ✅ Extension Status: READY FOR TESTING

Your URL Blocker Chrome extension is fully prepared for testing and debugging. All required files are present and configured correctly.

## 📁 Files Included:

### Core Extension Files:

- ✅ `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- ✅ `src/background/serviceWorker.js` - Main blocking logic
- ✅ `src/popup/popup.html|js|css` - Extension popup interface
- ✅ `src/confirm/confirm.html|js|css` - Confirmation/bypass page
- ✅ `src/shared/storage.js` - Data persistence layer
- ✅ `src/shared/domain.js` - Domain matching logic
- ✅ `icons/icon16|32|48|128.png` - Extension icons (auto-generated)

### Testing & Debug Files:

- ✅ `QUICK_TEST.md` - 10-minute testing guide
- ✅ `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive testing procedures
- ✅ `debug_bypasses.js` - Console debugging commands
- ✅ `create_icons.sh` - Icon generation script

## 🎯 Core Features to Test:

### 1. **Domain Blocking**

- **What to test:** Add `facebook.com`, navigate to `https://facebook.com`
- **Expected:** Redirects to confirmation page
- **Verify:** Blocks main domain and all subdomains

### 2. **"Really Go" Single-Use**

- **What to test:** Click "Really Go" button on confirmation page
- **Expected:** Navigates to site successfully
- **Verify:** Only works once per session, then blocks again

### 3. **Temporary Bypass with Countdown**

- **What to test:** Set 5-minute bypass, navigate to blocked site multiple times
- **Expected:** No confirmation for 5 minutes, then blocks again
- **Verify:** Countdown works and bypass expires

### 4. **Data Persistence**

- **What to test:** Add domains, restart Chrome completely, test blocking
- **Expected:** Blocked domains persist, bypasses do NOT persist
- **Verify:** Works after browser restart

### 5. **Service Worker Debugging**

- **What to test:** Monitor console logs during blocking/bypassing
- **Expected:** Detailed logs showing block decisions and bypass status
- **Verify:** `chrome://extensions/` → service worker → console logs

## 🔧 Debug Tools Available:

### Service Worker Console Commands:

```javascript
// Check storage state
chrome.storage.local.get(['blockedDomains', 'bypasses'], console.log);

// Force bypass cleanup
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'cleanup' });

// Check bypass status for domain
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
  {
    action: 'hasActiveBypass',
    data: { domain: 'facebook.com' }
  },
  console.log
);
```

### Quick Debug Functions:

(Copy from `debug_bypasses.js` into service worker console)

- `checkBypassStatus('domain.com')`
- `showDetailedBypassInfo()`
- `clearAllBypasses()`

## 🚀 Quick Start (10 minutes):

1. **Load Extension:** `chrome://extensions/` → Developer mode → Load unpacked
2. **Add Test Domain:** Extension popup → Enter "facebook.com" → Add
3. **Test Blocking:** Navigate to `https://facebook.com` → Should show confirmation
4. **Test "Really Go":** Click button → Should work once only
5. **Test Bypass:** Create 5min bypass → Should work temporarily
6. **Check Logs:** `chrome://extensions/` → service worker → console
7. **Test Persistence:** Restart Chrome → Domains should remain blocked

## 📊 Expected Performance:

- **Load time:** < 100ms
- **Block detection:** < 50ms per request
- **Memory usage:** < 10MB background script
- **Storage:** < 1KB per 100 domains

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Extension Won't Load:

- Verify `manifest.json` syntax
- Check all file paths exist
- Enable Developer mode

### Blocking Doesn't Work:

- Check service worker console for errors
- Verify webRequest permission granted
- Ensure testing main_frame navigation (not resources)

### Bypass Issues:

- Use debug commands to check bypass status
- Verify time-based expiration logic
- Check storage state before/after operations

## ✅ Success Criteria:

Your extension is working correctly if:

- ✅ Blocks main domains and subdomains
- ✅ "Really Go" works exactly once per session
- ✅ Bypasses work for specified duration then expire
- ✅ Blocked domains persist after browser restart
- ✅ Service worker logs show expected blocking/bypass behavior
- ✅ No console errors during normal operation
